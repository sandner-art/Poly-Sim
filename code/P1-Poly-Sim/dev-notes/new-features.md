### 1. Curvature: From Fields to Folds and Black Holes

You've hit on a key concept from Paper 2. The current implementation of the "Curvature Field" is a good starting point, but we can make it far more powerful and representative of your theory.

**How "Curvature Black Holes" should work:**
Conceptually, a "black hole" in this context is not about gravity, but about flow. It's a region of such extreme curvature that the geometric focusing effect becomes absolute. Any agent path that enters its "event horizon" is captured and cannot escape. In our simulation, this would be a very sharp peak or valley in the curvature field, causing the agent's steering to be so strongly influenced that it gets locked into a tight spiral. The `curvatureStrength` slider already allows you to approach this behavior.

**The best way to represent folding and curvature:**
Your idea to use a grayscale image is perfect. It's the most intuitive and powerful way to implement the ideas from Paper 2. It unifies the concepts of environment and geometry.

*   **Proposal: Curvature Maps.**
    *   We can add a new button: **"Load Curvature Map"** right next to the "Load Environment Mask".
    *   This image would not define blockages, but the underlying geometry of the space.
    *   **Interpretation:**
        *   **50% Gray (128):** Represents a flat, Euclidean space (zero curvature). This would be the default.
        *   **White (255):** Represents a high peak (strong positive curvature), which would strongly focus agent paths.
        *   **Black (0):** Represents a deep valley or "sump" (also strong positive curvature), which would also focus paths.
        *   **Gradients:** The gradients between these values create the steering forces. A sharp cliff in the image would be a powerful "wall" of force, bending agent paths along it.

This single feature would directly allow you to simulate folding. You could draw a series of parallel white and black lines to represent the gyri (peaks) and sulci (valleys) of a brain, and observe how the network preferentially forms along them and connects across them.

### 2. Environment: Pathfinding and Hard Boundaries

These are crucial features for making the simulation a true experimental testbed for network efficiency.

**Non-passable Maze Walls:**
Absolutely. The current "soft" grayscale walls are great for showing how flow can navigate difficult terrain, but for classic maze-solving and efficiency tests, you need hard boundaries.

*   **Proposal: "Hard Boundaries" Toggle.**
    *   Add a simple checkbox in the "Environment" section: `[ ] Use Hard Boundaries`.
    *   When checked, the `loadMaskFile` and `generateMaze` functions will process the mask to be purely binary: any pixel with brightness < 50% becomes `0.0` (impassable), and any pixel >= 50% becomes `1.0` (passable).
    *   This allows for direct comparison between flow in "porous" vs. "solid" environments.

**Setting a Starting Point:**
This is one of the most important additions we can make. The current "Big Bang" start is great for simulating cosmic web formation, but to test pathfinding (like Physarum solving a maze), you need a defined origin.

*   **Proposal: "Set Start Point" Tool.**
    *   We can introduce a new "brush mode." A small UI element could let you choose between:
        1.  **Spawn Agents (Default):** The current click-and-drag behavior.
        2.  **Set Start Point:** A new mode. When you click on the canvas in this mode, it will **clear all existing agents and respawn the entire population in a small, dense circle at the click location.**
    *   This instantly transforms the simulation from a general growth model into a specific search model. You can generate a maze, set a start point at one end, and watch the system find the exit.

### 3. Deeper Theory: Emergent Functions and Feedback

This question moves us toward demonstrating Paper 3—the "why" behind the network's structure. How can we simulate the emergence of function and the system's thermodynamic drive?

**Adjustments for the Flow-Based Feedback Loop:**
The core of your equation `∂C/∂t = R(G(C)) - D(C)` is the balance between Reinforcement (`R`) and Dissipation (`D`). The UI already has sliders for this (`Deposit Strength` and `Decay Rate`), but we can make the connection more explicit and powerful.

*   **Proposal 1: UI Renaming.** Rename the "Parameters" section to **"Feedback Loop (R-D)"** to make the theoretical link obvious.
*   **Proposal 2: Diffusion Control.** The `diffusionRate` is currently a hidden parameter tied to presets. We should expose it with its own slider. Diffusion is a key part of the `D(C)` operator, representing the "cost" of maintaining sharp, distinct paths. Giving the user control over it allows them to explore the trade-off between high-definition, costly paths and blurry, low-cost paths.

**Simulation of Functional "Organs":**
This is a brilliant idea. An "organ" is a specialized region that performs a function. In our flow network, the most basic function is transport.

*   **Proposal: Source and Sink Nodes.**
    *   We can add two new tools to our "brush mode" selector: **"Place Source"** and **"Place Sink"**.
    *   **Source (`S`):** A point on the canvas that continuously emits a small number of new agents at a steady rate. This is the "input" to the system.
    *   **Sink (`O`):** A point that **absorbs and removes** any agent that comes within its radius. This is the "output" or "processor."
    *   **The Effect:** With a Source and Sink active, the simulation is no longer about random exploration. It gains a *purpose*: to create the most efficient possible channel for transporting agents from `S` to `O`. This is a direct, visual demonstration of a network self-organizing to perform a function. It perfectly simulates the free energy principle: the system will physically alter itself (`∂C/∂t`) to find the lowest-energy (most efficient) path to satisfy the environmental demand (flow from S to O).

### Recommended Implementation Plan

1.  **(High Impact, Low Effort):** Implement the **"Set Start Point"** tool. This is a fundamental feature for pathfinding experiments. I'll provide the code for this below to get you started immediately.
2.  **(Low Effort):** Add the **"Hard Boundaries"** toggle. This is a simple modification to the mask processing logic.
3.  **(Medium Effort, High Impact):** Implement **loading Curvature Maps** from grayscale images. This is the centerpiece for demonstrating Paper 2.
4.  **(Medium Effort, High Impact):** Implement **Source and Sink nodes**. This is the key to demonstrating functional emergence and the principles of Paper 3.

### Code Implementation: Setting a Starting Point

Here is the code to implement the "Set Start Point" functionality. You'll need to add a button to your HTML and then integrate this logic into your JavaScript.

**1. Add HTML Buttons for the new tools:**
In the `Environment` section, or a new "Tools" section, add:

```html
<!-- Example HTML for a new "Tools" section -->
<div class="section">
    <div class="section-title">Interaction Tools</div>
    <div class="button-grid three-col">
        <div class="action-btn" onclick="setBrushMode('spawn')">Spawn Agents</div>
        <div class="action-btn" onclick="setBrushMode('start')">Set Start</div>
        <div class="action-btn" onclick="setBrushMode('none')">Pan/Zoom</div> <!-- Placeholder for future -->
    </div>
</div>
```

**2. Add JavaScript Logic:**

```javascript
// Add a new global variable at the top of your script
let brushMode = 'spawn'; // 'spawn', 'start'

// Create a new function to change the mode
function setBrushMode(mode) {
    brushMode = mode;
    canvas.style.cursor = (mode === 'spawn') ? 'crosshair' : (mode === 'start') ? 'pointer' : 'grab';
    console.log("Brush mode set to:", mode);
}

// Create the function to reset agents to a specific point
function setStartingPoint(simX, simY) {
    agents = []; // Clear all existing agents
    const spawnRadius = 20; // Spawn in a 20-pixel radius circle

    for (let i = 0; i < params.agentCount; i++) {
        const angle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2;
        const r = Math.sqrt(Math.random()) * spawnRadius; // Use sqrt for uniform distribution
        const x = simX + Math.cos(angle) * r;
        const y = simY + Math.sin(angle) * r;
        // Give them a random outward-facing angle to start
        agents.push(new Agent(x, y, angle));
    }
}

// Modify your existing 'mousedown' or 'touchstart' event handler
function startDrawing(x, y) {
    const coords = screenToSimCoords(x, y);

    if (brushMode === 'start') {
        setStartingPoint(coords.x, coords.y);
        setBrushMode('spawn'); // Revert to spawn mode after setting the start
        return; // Stop further execution
    }
    
    // The rest of your original startDrawing logic for spawning agents
    if (wormholePlacingMode) {
        placeWormhole(x, y);
        return;
    }
    isDrawing = true;
    spawnAgentsAt(x, y); // This is your existing function
}
```

### Category 1: Visualizations & Analytics (Making the Theory Visible)

These features are about adding data overlays and metrics to help you *see* the underlying principles at work, not just the final pattern.

#### 1. Real-Time Analytics Graph
**What it is:** A small, persistent line graph in a corner of the screen that plots key simulation metrics over time.
**Why it's important:** Your first paper is about **criticality and phase transitions**. A graph is the *perfect* way to visualize this. You would be able to see the system settle into a stable state (equilibrium), see sharp collapses when parameters are pushed too far, or observe the "double phase transition" from Paper 2 when wormholes activate.
**How it would work:**
*   Create a separate small `<canvas>` element for the graph.
*   Every half-second, calculate a few key metrics:
    *   **Network Efficiency (from P3):** You've already implemented this; now just plot it over time.
    *   **Total Conductivity (System "Mass"):** The sum of all values in the `conductivityField`. This represents the total "cost" of the network.
    *   **Agent Count:** Especially useful with sources/sinks to see if the system can reach a stable population.
*   Plot these values on the graph, which scrolls sideways as time progresses.

#### 2. Flow Vector Field Overlay
**What it is:** A toggleable overlay that shows the direction and magnitude of agent flow at every point on the canvas.
**Why it's important:** Currently, you see the *history* of the flow (the deposited trails). This would show the *instantaneous* flow. It directly visualizes the `F` in your `G(C)` function from Paper 1 and makes concepts like curvature-driven flow (Paper 2) immediately obvious, as you'd see vectors bending around peaks and valleys.
**How it would work:**
*   Create a new data grid (e.g., `flowFieldX`, `flowFieldY`).
*   In the agent `update()` loop, in addition to depositing conductivity, each agent adds its `dx` and `dy` velocity components to the grid cell it's currently in.
*   In the `render()` loop, if the overlay is active, draw small lines or arrows on a coarse grid, with their direction and brightness determined by the values in the `flowField`. This field would also need a decay rate, just like the conductivity field.

### Category 2: Interactive Experiments (Testing the Theory)

These features give you more direct ways to set up controlled experiments to test specific hypotheses from your papers.

#### 3. Agent "Species" & Typed Deposits
**What it is:** Introduce two or more types of agents (e.g., "Red" and "Blue"). Each agent type is attracted to trails left by its own kind but is neutral or repelled by trails from other types.
**Why it's important:** This simulates competition and the emergence of specialized, parallel networks. It's a powerful analogy for different neural circuits operating in the same brain region or competing biological organisms carving out distinct territories. It tests the robustness of the **Free Energy Principle (Paper 3)** under competitive pressure: can the system find an optimal state for *multiple* competing demands?
**How it would work:**
*   Modify the `Agent` class to include a `type` property (e.g., `agent.type = 'red'`).
*   Instead of one `conductivityField`, you'd have multiple (e.g., `conductivityFieldRed`, `conductivityFieldBlue`).
*   When an agent samples the environment, it only samples from the field corresponding to its type.
*   When rendering, you could blend the different fields together with different color palettes.

#### 4. Dynamic Environments
**What it is:** The ability for the environment to change *during* the simulation.
**Why it's important:** A core tenet of the **Free Energy Principle (Paper 3)** is that systems adapt to minimize "surprise" from a changing world. A static maze is a solved problem. A dynamic one requires constant adaptation and plasticity.
**How it would work (two ideas):**
*   **Moving Sources/Sinks:** Add a checkbox `[ ] Animate Sources/Sinks`. When checked, the source and sink nodes you've placed will begin to move slowly across the canvas, forcing the network to constantly rebuild and find new optimal paths.
*   **Shifting Mask:** The `maskField` could be slowly translated or rotated over time, forcing the network to adapt to a changing landscape.

### Category 3: Advanced Simulation Dynamics (Modeling the Theory Directly)

These are more complex features that would represent the pinnacle of simulating your theoretical concepts.

#### 5. Emergent Shortcut Formation (The Proximity Operator)
**What it is:** An automated system that finds locations for and creates "wormholes" (shortcuts) on its own, based on the principles of folding in Paper 2.
**Why it's important:** This is the ultimate demonstration of **Geometric Criticality**. The paper argues that U-fibers in the brain form *because* of folding. This feature would simulate that process. Instead of placing shortcuts manually, the simulation would discover the most efficient places for them, proving that the geometry itself is driving the network's topological evolution.
**How it would work (this is complex):**
*   Periodically (e.g., every 10 seconds), run a "shortcut scan."
*   The scan would randomly sample points in the `conductivityField` that have high intensity.
*   For each sampled point, it would search for another high-intensity point that is **close in screen-space (Euclidean distance) but far away when tracing a path along the network (geodesic distance)**.
*   If such a pair is found, a "proto-wormhole" is created, slowly strengthening over time if agents use it, and fading if they don't.

#### 6. Activity-Dependent Costs
**What it is:** A more realistic thermodynamic model where maintaining a path has a cost proportional to its strength.
**Why it's important:** This directly models the **`f_cost(C)` term from the Free Energy Functional in Paper 3**. It forces the system to be truly efficient. It's not enough to build a superhighway; you have to be able to *afford* it. This would prevent the network from growing indefinitely and would favor leaner, more optimized structures.
**How it would work:**
*   Modify the decay logic in `updateSimulation()`.
*   Instead of `conductivityField[i] *= params.decayRate;`
*   Use a function like: `conductivityField[i] *= (params.decayRate - conductivityField[i] * 0.01);`
*   In this example, the decay rate becomes more aggressive as conductivity (`C`) increases. This means high-traffic paths cost more to maintain, forcing a tighter balance between reinforcement and dissipation.
