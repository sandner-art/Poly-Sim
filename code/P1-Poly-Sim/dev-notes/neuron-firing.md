### Conceptual Improvements

1.  **Conditional Firing:** Instead of firing randomly, agents will fire based on their environment. The most logical condition in this simulation is encountering a **junction**.
2.  **Signal Propagation:** When an agent fires, it won't just create a static splash. It will launch a "signal" packet that travels along the established conductive pathways, visually showing information flow.
3.  **Oscillator Mode:** A mode where agents fire periodically, acting like pacemakers. This can reveal resonance and interference patterns within the network.
4.  **Enhanced Visuals:** Propagating signals will have a distinct, high-contrast color to differentiate them from the base network.
