**The GPU Acceleration is NOT yet truly implemented. The checkbox is a non-functional UI element.**

### From the Code

1.  **Core Logic is CPU-Bound:** The most intensive parts of the simulation—agent updates and field diffusion—are handled by standard JavaScript `for` loops.
    *   In `updateSimulation()`, the line `for (const agent of agents) { agent.update(); ... }` iterates through every agent one-by-one on the CPU.
    *   In `applyDiffusion()`, the nested loops `for (let y = 1; y < height - 1; y++) { for (let x = 1; x < width - 1; x++) { ... } }` process the conductivity field pixel-by-pixel on the CPU.
2.  **`useGPU` Variable is Never Used:** The `useGPU` variable is set to `true` when you check the box, but it is never referenced again in any part of the simulation logic. A real implementation would have a large `if (useGPU) { ... } else { ... }` block to completely change how the `updateSimulation` function works.
3.  **No GPGPU Code:** A true GPU implementation for this kind of simulation would use a technique called GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units). This involves:
    *   Writing **shaders** (small programs that run on the GPU) in a language like GLSL (for WebGL) or WGSL (for WebGPU).
    *   Loading your simulation data (e.g., agent positions, the conductivity field) into GPU **textures** or **buffers**.
    *   Executing the shaders to perform calculations on all the data in parallel.
    *   There are no shader programs, buffer uploads for computation, or GPGPU-style draw calls anywhere in the code.

### How to Implement True GPU Acceleration (with WebGPU)

Your instinct is correct: **WebGPU is the ideal modern technology for this task.** While you *can* perform GPGPU tasks with WebGL, it often involves clever workarounds like encoding data into textures and rendering to an off-screen canvas.

WebGPU is designed for this. It has first-class support for **Compute Shaders**, which are made specifically for general-purpose parallel computation, not just for drawing triangles.

Here is a conceptual roadmap to refactor your application for a real and effective WebGPU implementation:

1.  **Isolate the Simulation State:** Your primary data points are the array of `agents` (each with x, y, angle) and the `conductivityField`.

2.  **Create GPU Buffers:** Instead of storing this data in JavaScript arrays, you would create `GPUBuffer` objects to hold it on the GPU. You would have one buffer for the agent data and two for the conductivity field (one for reading the previous state, one for writing the new state).

3.  **Write a Compute Shader in WGSL:** You would write a compute shader program. This program would be executed on the GPU once for every agent. Each instance (or "thread") of the shader would:
    *   Read the data for its assigned agent from the agent buffer.
    *   Sample the conductivity field (by reading from the input conductivity buffer).
    *   Perform the same sensor logic and movement calculations as your current `agent.update()` function.
    *   Write the agent's new position and angle back to the agent buffer.
    *   Atomically add a deposit value to the output conductivity buffer at the agent's new location.

4.  **Create a Compute Pipeline:** In your JavaScript, you would set up a `GPUComputePipeline` that uses your compiled WGSL shader and defines the layout of the GPU buffers.

5.  **Dispatch the Work:** In your `animate` loop, instead of the CPU-based `for` loop in `updateSimulation()`, you would encode a "compute pass" and call `pass.dispatchWorkgroups()`. This single command tells the GPU to execute your shader for all agents in parallel, which is drastically faster.

6.  **Render the Result:** The existing 2D canvas rendering logic can remain largely the same. It would read the final, computed `conductivityField` back from the GPU (or use a texture that the GPU writes to) and draw it to the screen.
