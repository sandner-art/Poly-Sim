Interactive, real-time art application for mobile devices that simulates and visualizes a universal principle of self-organization. It generates and compares complex, filamentary networks based on a single, unified algorithm. 

> The current app is an implementation of a specific case (agent-based approximation of a global system on a 2D plane with simulated geometric effects)

The user can interact with the simulation and switch between "skins" or presets that frame the same underlying process as different natural phenomena: the growth of a slime mold (Physarum), the behavior of astrophysical plasma, and the formation of neural pathways.

> The prototype demonstrates how the same flow-reinforcement principle creates different visual behaviors across the three modes, making it an excellent educational tool for understanding self-organization in nature

## Core Scientific Premise

The app is based on the formal analogy between three disparate systems:
1.  Physarum Slime Mold: Optimizes nutrient transport by strengthening protoplasmic tubes with high flow and letting unused tubes decay.
2.  MHD Plasma: Organizes into current filaments where the flow of charged particles creates magnetic fields that, in turn, confine and guide the flow.
3.  Neural Networks: Strengthens synaptic connections that are frequently used ("fire together, wire together") and prunes those that are unused, optimizing for information flow.

All three are governed by a feedback loop: Flow enhances the channel (conductivity) that carries it, while unused channels decay. Poly-Sim models this core principle.

## The Core Algorithm

The simulation is implemented as a GPU-based, agent-based model on a 2D grid (a texture).

State Data: The Conductivity Field C
A high-resolution floating-point texture where each pixel's value represents the "conductivity" or "path desirability" at that point.

Flow Data: The Agents
A large array (100k to 1M+) of simple particles, each with a position (x, y) and a direction vector (dx, dy).

The Main Simulation Loop (to be executed entirely on the GPU every frame):

Agent Update Step (Flow Calculation G(C)):
For each agent, read the C value from the texture at its current position and at two other "sensor" points ahead of it (e.g., at current_pos + rotated_direction(sensor_angle) and current_pos + rotated_direction(-sensor_angle)).
Steer the agent's direction vector towards the sensor point with the highest C value.
Add a small random value to the direction to prevent getting stuck.
Move the agent forward according to its new direction vector. Agents that move off-screen should wrap around to the other side.

Reinforcement Step (Feedback R(F)):
For each agent, increase the value of the pixel in the C texture at its new position by a small, fixed "deposit strength". This makes paths stronger where agents have traveled.

Dissipation Step (Decay D(C)):
This step is applied to the entire C texture.
a) Decay: Multiply the entire texture by a constant decay factor (e.g., 0.98). This makes all paths fade over time. C *= decay_rate.
b) Diffusion: Apply a slight blur filter to the texture. This smooths the paths, prevents aliasing, and encourages nearby paths to merge, creating more organic, river-like structures.

## How Each Preset Demonstrates Self-Organization

1. **Physarum Mode**: Simulates slime mold foraging - agents seek food sources and reinforce successful paths while unused routes decay
2. **Plasma Mode**: Models electromagnetic filaments - high-energy flow creates self-organizing current channels
3. **Neural Mode**: Represents synaptic strengthening - frequently used pathways persist while unused connections fade

## Mobile Performance

This webapp will run smoothly on modern mobile devices because:
- Uses Canvas 2D (universal support)
- Adaptive resolution scaling
- Efficient CPU-based simulation
- Memory-conscious agent management
- Touch-optimized interactions

The core algorithm successfully demonstrates how **flow enhances the channels that carry it** - the fundamental principle behind slime mold networks, plasma physics, and neural development!

Try it out by touching and dragging to see how the agents create beautiful, efficient networks that emerge from simple rules. Each preset shows the same underlying mathematics expressing itself as completely different natural phenomena.
